This project will use the foursquare dataset to explore neighborhoods for venues and the categories data. In addition, this project will also use the Zomato dataset. Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company founded by Pankaj Chaddah and Deepinder Goyal in 2008.[7][8] Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities.[9] As of 2019, the service is available in 24 countries and in more than 10,000 cities. The dataset used is taken from kaggle website ( https://www.kaggle.com/rabhar/zomato-restaurants-in-india?select=zomato_restaurants_in_India.csv ). It contains restaurants with their ratings, votes, other crucial data attributes to do research work and projects. This project will use some of the attributes like ratings, cuisine, expensiveness etc. to reach the target of the project.
