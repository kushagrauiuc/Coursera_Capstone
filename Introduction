Hundreds of dining places open and close within a matter of weeks in Bangalore (rather they used to before the pandemic). One of the main reasons for closure is the inappropriate choice of location for opening the restaurants/cafe. For example, choosing a location where the well established competitors exist already may not be the best idea. Further, based on the type of cuisine, if the location chosen is not in sync with the residents of the neighborhood, the footfall will not be enough to keep the place running. A well thought out location will provide a large advantage in terms of competition, footfalls, sales and brand recognition.

This project aims to solve the above problem - help the restaurant owners understand and choose suitable locations for opening their restaurants/cafes in Bangalore - so as to increase their chances of survival and profits.
